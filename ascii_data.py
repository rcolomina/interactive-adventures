You find yourself standing at the edge of the Grimmoor Forest, shrouded in mist and mystery. 
The old road winds before you like a serpent, leading into the heart of the dark woodland.

A foul curse has settled over the land, the work of a dark sorcerer who resides in the Blackthorn Keep, 
an ancient fortress perched atop the jagged cliffs of Valthor. No one has seen the sorcerer, but the tales speak of his cruelty and power.

Villages have withered, their crops rotting in the fields. Strange creatures roam the night, attacking travelers, 
while disease spreads with alarming speed. The once-proud kingdom of Theron is on its knees.

King Alaric himself has offered a reward of untold riches for anyone who dares to lift the curse. Many have tried, all have failed.

      
But you are different. You have no noble blood, nor grand lineage. You are a traveler, a wandererâ€”armed with nothing but your courage and wits. 
The people whisper of an ancient weapon hidden deep within the Keep, a blade that has the power to slay the sorcerer and break the curse forever.

Armed with your sword, a few provisions, and the faint hope that luck may be on your side, you step forward. 
The path to Blackthorn Keep is treacherous, filled with dangers seen and unseen. Each step you take brings you closer to the shadow of the cursed fortress. 
Will you have the skill, the stamina, and the luck to face the horrors that await? Or will you become another forgotten soul lost to the darkness?
